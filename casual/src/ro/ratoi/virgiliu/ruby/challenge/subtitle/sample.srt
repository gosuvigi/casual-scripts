1
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,594
My poor baby.

2
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,595
Who has stolen the child's dream?

3
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,937
The mad genius Krank
in his evil scheme.

4
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,637
To what vicious depths
will he not descend?

5
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,339
Will the tale turn to tragedy...

6
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,382
or have a happy end?

7
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,765
Step up, ladies and gentlemen!

8
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,808
Step right up! Come closer.

9
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,536
Don't be afraid.

10
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,078
See the strongest man in the world.

11
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,343
Look at those chains,
made of the same steel...

12
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,112
as that used to lift--

13
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,618
Yes, my friends--

14
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,518
The true light is invisible.

15
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,853
Penetrate the corridor of shadows...

16
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,792
and you will enter
the world of the chosen ones.

17
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,921
Renounce the gift of sight.

18
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,864
I know there are skeptics among you...

19
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,868
afraid to share with us
the dead of night.

20
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,871
Be brave.
Renounce your gift of sight.

21
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,874
Pluck out your eyes.
Come and join us.

22
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,536
Help us build a better world.

23
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:17,082
The crusher Bones is going to try
once more to shatter steel...

24
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:22,120
only using the power
of his mighty arms.

25
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,782
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
I want absolute silence...

26
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,688
during the demonstration.

27
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,853
I must beg of you,
for your own safety...

28
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,954
not to look him in the eye...

29
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,398
because his power of concentration
is so great...

30
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,562
that he might provoke
a cerebral hemorrhage...

31
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,572
in the weaker ones among you.

32
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,904
Mr. One, ready?
And now, attention!

33
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,374
Little thief!

34
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,542
Stealing money from orphans.
I'll teach you !

35
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,313
Let go of that!

36
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,319
What's going on?
What's the matter?

37
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,325
The poor man's not well.

38
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,619
Don't move!
Don't move or I'll waste you!

39
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,230
Denree!

40
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,772
Kill him!

41
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,342
- Who's that?
- He's the strong man at the fun fair.

42
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,979
I don't know him.

43
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,283
What do you want?

44
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,869
I have lost little brother.

45
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,210
He didn't come all by himself.

46
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,199
Well, well, kiddies, hard at work?

47
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,336
It looks like you're doing
really well.

48
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,372
Thanks for waiting for us.

49
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,665
Thank you.

50
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,214
Just remember,
my ears are so sharp...

51
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,555
that I can hear you think.

52
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,731
Go buy yourself some sweets.

53
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,379
Don't overdo it.

54
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,348
Come on. Move your bum.

55
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,110
Go on. Here.

56
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,382
Move it!

57
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,229
Get the tools and let's beat it.

58
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,629
Move it!

59
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,794
Those rotten Cyclops.

60
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,737
Don't worry.
We know where to find them.

61
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,268
And him?
What about him?

62
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,280
You helped us out.
Here. Now we're even.

63
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:45,954
Hey, girl. Cyclops.
You know where to find Cyclops?

64
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,726
Will you get lost?

65
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,301
Beat it!

66
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,898
Happy birthday, Uncle dear

67
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,239
Our wish is most sincere

68
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,781
We hope this cake of ours
will bring you happiness

69
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,112
Good fortune and success

70
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,118
Wait till the candles are bIown out!

71
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,383
In fair or foul weather
We'll always be together

72
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,183
Happy birthday, Uncle lrvin.

73
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,194
A cake for me?

74
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,196
You're really too kind.

75
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,794
Are you ready, children?

76
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,929
Not you.
You've got a cold.

77
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,436
One, two.

78
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,314
What is all this bellowing about?

79
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,216
But, sweetheart,
it's lrvin's birthday.

80
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,152
Irvin's birthday?

81
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,714
Why, of course.
How could I have forgotten?

82
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,521
Let us celebrate.

83
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,858
Let us all make merry.

84
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,627
Everyone, let's shout!
Scream out!

85
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,534
Krank, come back.
I had a thought last night.

86
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,266
lf these children
only have nightmares...

87
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,070
it's perhaps
because the evil is in you.

88
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,736
Why not seek the cause
of your torment...

89
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,406
in the molecular study
of your own tears?

90
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,915
Who could make me cry?

91
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,815
Well, boss...

92
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,821
we could make you cry
with laughter.

93
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,185
I am a gnome
a bag of bones

94
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,728
A man of means
and full of beans

95
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,835
The girls in Spain
sing my refrains

96
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,406
I've such a pain
that it's insane

97
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,417
You mustn't be angry.

98
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,920
Your brothers are doing their best.

99
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,122
My brothers?

100
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,792
May I give it a try?

101
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,131
Go ahead, mollusk.

102
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,464
Once upon a time,
there was an inventor so gifted...

103
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,700
that he could create life.

104
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,040
- Truly remarkable man.
- Ah, a fairy tale.

105
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,239
I can already feel tears
in my eyes.

106
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,714
Since he had no wife or children...

107
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,548
he decided to make them
in his laboratory.

108
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,986
He started with his wife
and fashioned her...

109
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,048
into the most beautiful princess
in the world.

110
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:31,324
Alas, a wicked genetic fairy
cast a spell on the inventor...

111
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,800
so much so that the princess
was only knee-high to a grasshopper.

112
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,300
He then cloned six children
in his own image.

113
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:44,103
Faithful, hardworking,
they were so alike...

114
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,143
no one could tell them apart.

115
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:49,874
But fate tricked him again,
giving them all sleeping sickness.

116
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,852
Craving someone to talk to,
he grew in a fish tank...

117
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,480
a poor migraine-ridden brain.

118
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:01,424
And then, at last,
he created his masterpiece...

119
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,951
more intelligent than
the most intelligent man on Earth.

120
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,193
But, alas, the inventor
made a serious mistake.

121
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,703
While his creation was intelligent,
he, too, had a defect.

122
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,398
He never, ever had a dream.

123
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,465
You can't imagine
how quickly he grew old...

124
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,602
because he was so unhappy.

125
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,281
Boss.

126
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,084
There!

127
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,855
An eye dropper, quick!

128
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,021
An eye dropper!

129
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,247
Then the poor masterpiece
became so crazed...

130
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,648
that he believed
a single teardrop could save him.

131
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,312
And, after committing
many cruel deeds...

132
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,413
he died a horrible death...

133
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,323
never knowing
what it is to dream.

134
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,826
Get out!

135
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,488
All of you, get out!

136
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,094
Good-bye, Uncle. Happy birthday.
See you tonight.

137
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,665
Silence...

138
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,172
you glub!

139
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,435
What do you expect us
to do with that?

140
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,772
I wouldn't waste a nail
to hang it up.

141
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,311
But it's pretty, isn't it?

142
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,314
Don't get smart with us.

143
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,646
The picklock won't always
be there to save your behind.

144
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,610
All right, get lost.

145
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,991
- That's all?
- Afraid so.

146
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,996
lf you keep being sassy--

147
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,531
You'll be sorry.

148
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,625
There's no shortage
of orphans, Miette.

149
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,710
Listen carefully, Tadpole.

150
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,578
You don't want to go
to the hole, do you?

151
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,914
- It's very cold there.
- And pitch black.

152
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,851
And full of spiders.

153
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,913
So give us all the rest.
The rest.

154
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,594
There's a fine lad.

155
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,259
See? When you want to.

156
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,565
Now, the second shift.

157
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,115
The neighborhood's calm, isolated.
But be careful.

158
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,548
You never know.
There's a backyard.

159
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,916
You'll go that way
with all the stuff.

160
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,353
On the landing,
there are three doors.

161
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,357
One is locked from inside.

162
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,087
That's the one that must be forced.

163
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,152
Behind is what interests us.

164
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,564
Here's the prize.

165
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,132
It's identical to the one
where he hides his loot.

166
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,168
The problem with this safe:
it takes two hours to crack it.

167
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,270
Two hours?
We're going to get caught.

168
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:20,477
We have no choice, unless you know
someone capable of carrying it.

169
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,559
Somebody got in.

170
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,869
- You big idiot!
- He's right here now.

171
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,137
Do I pay you to sleepwalk?
Who is this guy?

172
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,303
- Don't ask me.
- I know who he is.

173
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,813
The strong man at the fair,
the one who breaks his chains.

174
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,149
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

175
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,433
Nice going, Mr. One.

176
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,440
One don't like whistles.
One not thief.

177
00:22:56,508 --> 00:23:00,501
A thief? Who's a thief?
We're not stealing, just borrowing.

178
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,239
What he said?

179
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,908
He said you can take it back.
It just won't be as heavy.

180
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,353
- The true light.
- Little brother.

181
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:17,623
Renounce fhe gift of sight
and penetrate the corridor of shadows...

182
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,459
the world of the blind.

183
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:23,365
That guy is crazy.
The Octopus will kill us.

184
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,404
Tell her I'll bring him back.
I won't be long.

185
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,634
Help us build a better world...

186
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,677
or we shall witness
a reign of terror.

187
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,009
One! Where do you think you're going?

188
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,982
Cyclops truck.
Denree, little brother.

189
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,984
What about the truck?

190
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,745
Cyclops truck.

191
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,219
Kidnap Denree.

192
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,226
Kidnap little brother.

193
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:53,253
You know something?
You won't find Cyclops truck like that.

194
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,232
When you get there,
someone will have eaten Denree.

195
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,735
The wolf will have eaten him.

196
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:04,006
Take a break.
No use wearing out your shoes.

197
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,543
I know where the truck's going.

198
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,606
Miette and One together?

199
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,413
And then what?

200
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,581
And anyway, how old
was this brother of yours?

201
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,855
Little, little brother.

202
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,360
Found him...

203
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,526
one night...

204
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,766
on his rubbish bin, crying.

205
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,033
One comes close.

206
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,772
Discover--

207
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,343
Okay, I can guess the rest.

208
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,877
He's just like I thought.
He's too little to bother.

209
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,891
Let's go.
We have to get out of here.

210
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,166
Stupid!

211
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,296
Imbecile! Idiot!

212
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,410
Have you finished?
My crystal glasses are broken!

213
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,412
You'll crack my chandelier!

214
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,623
Are you calmer now?

215
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,127
One look for Denree.

216
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,197
See you.

217
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,958
Oh, come on, fat head.

218
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,633
- Where did those brats go?
- I don't know.

219
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,834
It's the big guy's fault.
Miette's different since he came.

220
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:22,141
Does he have all the jewels?
That's all he's interested in?

221
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,011
You had big ideas?
Poor little Tadpole.

222
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,712
You haven't fallen in love, too,
like the others? Get to bed!

223
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,221
- Filthy brats.
- All the same.

224
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,723
We really can't count on them.

225
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,556
- Raise crows, they'll rip out--
- Your eyes.

226
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:40,962
- It's the best ones who want to go.
- It's not the first time it's happened.

227
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,057
It's always the same old story.

228
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,399
- Remember little Lucas six years ago?
- And Marcus before.

229
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,962
Yes, Marcus.
I'd almost forgotten him.

230
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,877
- When we think--
- Of everything we've done for them.

231
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,784
And if she had an accident?

232
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,385
You never know.

233
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,697
At that moment, the winkles
suddenly break into a dance...

234
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:52,396
then cast off their shells
and begin to use them as megaphones...

235
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,062
to announce the concert.

236
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,004
Winkles, winkles.
Shells, shells.

237
00:27:56,074 --> 00:28:00,340
And then, at that moment...

238
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,414
all the winkles
cast off their shells...

239
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,712
and use them as megaphones
to announce the concert.

240
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:10,414
The winkles?
The winkles cast off their shells?

241
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,217
Please continue.

242
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,088
Continue, and with colors as well.

243
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,752
Yes, yes, yes.

244
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:20,525
Then the hammerhead shark plays
xylophone with the catfish bones.

245
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,931
The walrus plays
the Jew's harp with the...

246
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,833
the sperm whale's suspenders.

247
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,896
The sea is blue like the sky...

248
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,737
and the sky is blue
like the South Seas.

249
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:35,279
And I don't know
if I'm swimming in the sky or...

250
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,907
or flying at the bottom
of the sea.

251
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,417
I swear it gives me the shivers.

252
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,848
Shivers? Shivers all over.

253
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,722
And igloos?
Oh, yes, tell me about the igloos.

254
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,660
lgloos that turn into mushrooms.

255
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:06,072
Ah, it's you, my boy.
I was expecting you.

256
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:09,977
Not so loud. Turn it down.
The boss might hear you.

257
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:13,950
The boss? He's out of a test tube,
like all of us.

258
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,953
Lay the boy in the sarcophagus
and come here.

259
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,552
But before--

260
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,225
Well, you promised me--

261
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,323
What's tormenting you, my son?

262
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:35,301
Well, this story that among us
there's an original clone...

263
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,500
different from the others.

264
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,167
Is that true?

265
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,713
Of course it's true. The others
are nothing but cheap copies...

266
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,909
while the original one is unique.

267
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,680
- Unique?
- Yes.

268
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,880
And do you know who it is?

269
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:55,221
Do you really want to know?
Connect yourself to the child.

270
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,325
- To the child?
- Yes.

271
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:05,028
Connect myself to the child?
But I can't.

272
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,704
It's forbidden.

273
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,603
Exactly.

274
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:13,872
The others wouldn't dare,
but you, you can do it...

275
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,878
because you're the original.

276
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,380
Me?

277
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,480
I'm the original?

278
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,181
But it's not lonely
being the original?

279
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:29,693
All the penguins, the centipedes,
everyone applauds.

280
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,219
Except, even if you climb
to the treetops...

281
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,165
it's impossible to catch
the candy floss.

282
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:39,294
And so, everybody climbs
to the top of the mountain...

283
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,635
except the giraffes who, of course,
stay in one spot...

284
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,299
munching the clouds.

285
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,110
Sleep.

286
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,079
Sleep, my little one.

287
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,519
I am the sandman...

288
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,521
and you can't resist me.

289
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,988
Your eyelids are so heavy.

290
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,051
Sleep, my little one.

291
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,429
The snowflakes evaporate...

292
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,404
and then turn into hailstones.

293
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,266
ln the farmyards...

294
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,573
the turkeys scramble towards...

295
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,580
the hailstones.

296
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,791
The better to peck them?

297
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,858
And then when the children's voices
cry for help...

298
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,699
the chickens are merciless.

299
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,151
There.

300
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,950
Now he's going to come around
very nicely.

301
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,548
- Who, the boss?
- No, the child.

302
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,718
He's a real nightmare factory.

303
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:14,454
- What's that? A fuse blew!
- Perfect.

304
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,139
Be careful.
Someone will hear you.

305
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,682
It's hard to be original.

306
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,345
Now, throw this message--
uh, bottle into the sea.

307
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,480
- Yes.
- Go on!

308
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:53,203
May someone find my plea
to get it over with.

309
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,826
l...

310
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,735
Gabriel Marie...

311
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:08,034
I came into this world
with open eyes...

312
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,613
but I saw a world...

313
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:14,617
that was a world of dogs.

314
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,277
Litter of dogs!

315
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,916
And so, the creator...

316
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:24,257
sent me down here to Earth...

317
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:28,458
to recover the power...

318
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:32,025
that men have illegally seized.

319
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,938
My brothers...

320
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:40,137
you who have joined me
in this struggle...

321
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,442
understand that together
we must fight...

322
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,574
human beings...

323
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,881
from their own grounds.

324
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,945
The world...

325
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,491
of appearances.

326
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,975
I thought we had agreed
on half a dozen.

327
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:23,077
But you know it's becoming
more and more difficult.

328
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,123
People are suspicious.
They've put up posters.

329
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:31,418
ln any case, this batch
is as fresh as they come.

330
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,829
Not one of them
is over five years old.

331
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:43,637
Listen. Let us have
maybe a couple of hours...

332
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,006
and we'll sort this thing out.

333
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,826
Only the third eye...

334
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,393
will enable you to enter...

335
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,832
the world of appearances.

336
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,369
But beware...

337
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:19,268
because this sordid world
of temptation and perversion...

338
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:23,370
is also the world of desire.

339
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,616
Try, Brother Angel Joseph...

340
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,220
to discover it...

341
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,758
without your losing sight...

342
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,850
of the only true light.

343
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,388
Be strong.

344
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,997
My brothers...

345
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,093
our grace...

346
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,298
our great superior race...

347
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,308
shall reign once more...

348
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,537
on Earth !

349
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,443
From that day on...

350
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,676
our faithful third eye...

351
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,310
will become useless...

352
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,219
as the world of appearances...

353
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,486
will be abolished.

354
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,785
It's Denree.

355
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,361
I see!

356
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:23,602
What's that?

357
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,108
That, Brother Angel Joseph...

358
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,144
is a female.

359
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,808
- A female.
- Do you have a problem?

360
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,448
What's that?

361
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,789
That is a condemned man.

362
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,732
Take them. Go on !

363
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,735
Come back when those idiots
have had enough.

364
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:59,676
Search her!

365
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,110
What is it?

366
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,318
Kill her!

367
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,046
She's clean.

368
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,648
Then tomorrow night at Pier 24.

369
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,264
100,000.

370
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,645
We'll never get half that.

371
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,972
One more scrap of information.

372
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,881
A girl in a red dress...

373
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,546
with a big moron.

374
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,186
We found these on them.

375
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,195
But there was much more in the--

376
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,064
What'll you do with them?

377
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:08,673
A midnight snack for the fishes,
tonight, Pier 24.

378
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,713
A midnight snack for the fishes.

379
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,519
- lrvin?
- Such a migraine.

380
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,915
You know all about feelings.

381
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,520
Won't you try to help me?

382
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:28,156
Won't you explain why all those children
only have nightmares?

383
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,427
'Cause you were their nightmare.

384
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:33,595
You can persecute
all the children in the world...

385
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,105
but there's one thing
you'll never have.

386
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,198
- What?
- A soul.

387
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:45,180
Because you believe you have one?

388
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,308
You don't even have a body.

389
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:51,445
He who created us
made us all monsters.

390
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:55,253
No, Krank, you're wrong.
You are the only monster here.

391
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,022
Be quiet!
He's the only one responsible.

392
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:01,462
For that, I say I'm innocent.
I'm innocent!

393
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,377
Anyway...

394
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,117
I thank you for your help.

395
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:24,051
Hurry up! And don't break
any of the baubles.

396
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:28,085
Well done.
And don't cut yourself.

397
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,995
Are you sure that we're doing
the right thing?

398
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,331
Of course, my pet.
All children love it.

399
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,098
Lift your elbow.

400
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,197
Why worry, Krank?

401
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,300
lf you're sincere,
you have nothing to lose.

402
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,324
How are you, Marcello?

403
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,132
What's it to you?

404
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:19,540
We need you, Marcello,
and your creepy-crawlies.

405
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,578
Have you still got the knack?

406
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,671
No, please, not again.

407
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,511
I paid enough already.

408
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:31,287
- Nice place--
- You've got here, Marcello.

409
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:37,524
I'm glad to see
it hasn't changed much.

410
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,941
You know, I never liked
that blue cage.

411
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,179
You were always so kind
to us, Marcello.

412
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,910
- It's only fair--
- That we look after you--

413
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,417
Today.

414
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:06,389
- A little girl in a red dress--
- With a big moron.

415
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,254
We want him.

416
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,759
And what do I do with her?

417
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,632
A midnight snack for the fishes.

418
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,405
Come on, my little flea.

419
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,344
There, there.

420
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,346
Easy does it.

421
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,507
Midnight snack for the fishes.

422
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:25,385
Will you shut up, you idiots?

423
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:40,028
- It wasn't me.
- I don't care.

424
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:43,267
Work this out among yourselves.

425
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,469
How dare you hit the original.

426
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,979
You, the original?
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

427
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,571
Miette...

428
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:28,082
One will die?

429
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,417
You're born in the gutter.
You end up in the port.

430
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,383
Miette too little.

431
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,998
Not as little as all that.

432
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,337
Five thousand on the kid.

433
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:59,813
Ten thousand on the monster.

434
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,820
There are pebbles in the meat pie.

435
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,794
There are pebbles, bits of--

436
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,848
- Did you hear anything?
- Just them crazy birds.

437
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,853
- There's something over there.
- I don't see anything.

438
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:15,790
- Who is that guy there?
- What's all that monkey business?

439
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:22,597
Well, Brutus.

440
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:28,464
- I can't see anything now.
- Don't you like the music?

441
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,803
What you doing?

442
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,969
I can't see.

443
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:26,559
I don't want to be dead.

444
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:34,260
Jump! Go on! Jump!

445
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,865
Save Miette!

446
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,533
Hurry! Jump!

447
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:13,628
Found, West Pier,
eve of St. John.

448
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,451
Oh, it's a miracle!

449
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,388
She's come to.

450
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,656
Spit!

451
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:43,328
Feel better? Look at me.

452
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,163
Are you all right?

453
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,999
You're very lucky that I came by.

454
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:52,134
Haven't I seen you somewhere?

455
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,834
I doubt it.

456
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,008
No one ever sees me.

457
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,316
I'm always underwater.

458
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:03,079
Why?

459
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:05,747
It's dangerous up there.

460
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,351
- He wants to kill me.
- Who?

461
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:14,997
I can't remember anything.

462
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,693
Some people lose their marbles.

463
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:20,861
And me, I've lost my memory.

464
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,837
I'm glad you're here.

465
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,841
I bring in more than enough stuff
for two.

466
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,800
Look.

467
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,214
You see, I'm a treasure hunter.

468
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,044
The city's history is here.

469
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,611
Cast into the sea
and forgotten forever.

470
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:43,056
- I see.
- I'm here, cataloging, dating.

471
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,720
Wait. That's the land shark's safe.

472
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:49,026
Oh, yes.
Yes, I brought it in yesterday.

473
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:51,033
And this is Vito Nine Fingers.

474
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,467
Everyone thought he ran away
with his money.

475
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:56,734
They're wrong.
What are you doing?

476
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:59,639
I stole them.
I'm taking back what's mine.

477
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,268
Don't go back up there.

478
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:04,711
It's dangerous!

479
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:07,215
You're a kid.
Stay with me.

480
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:12,315
Well, thanks for everything,
but I've got to go.

481
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,152
Not that way.

482
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:23,057
- The children.
- What about them? What do you know?

483
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,933
He takes them.
The devil takes them away...

484
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,595
in his boat.

485
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,906
He takes them to hell.

486
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:35,172
- What hell?
- The Tattooed Man, he knows where.

487
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:39,280
The map.

488
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,944
The map of the minefield
is tattooed on his body.

489
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,251
It's all my fault.

490
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,419
This man's a proper nutcase.

491
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,431
Holy cow, it's little brother again.

492
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,170
Miette.

493
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,750
Take care of him.
He's hopeless.

494
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,748
Sure.

495
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,495
What's the trouble, handsome?

496
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,598
There's no reason to be depressed.

497
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,126
- What?
- The girl--

498
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:02,688
Yes. The girl drowned.
I wasn't going to resuscitate her.

499
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,758
- You should be twice as happy.
- Why are you sniffing?

500
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:08,929
Why I sniff? So what?
I caught a cold at the pier.

501
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:11,940
- Get ready in half an hour.
- In a half hour?

506
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:52,019
Cyclops truck kidnap little brother.

507
00:55:52,054 --> 00:55:54,021
Kidnap Denree.

508
00:55:57,983 --> 00:56:00,985
Very funny.
What are you doing here?

509
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:03,022
Well, smarty, it wasn't nice
of you to disappear.

510
00:56:03,023 --> 00:56:05,000
I'm sorry, but incredible things
happened to One and me.
